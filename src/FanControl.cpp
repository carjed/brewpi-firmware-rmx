These scripts were originally a part of firmware, a part of
the BrewPi project. Legacy support (for the very popular Arduino
controller) seems to have been discontinued in favor of new hardware.

All credit for the original firmware goes to @elcojacobs,
@m-mcgowan, @elnicoCZ, @ntfreak, @Gargy007 and I'm sure many more
contributors around the world. My apologies if I have missed anyone;
those were the names listed as contributors on the Legacy branch.
